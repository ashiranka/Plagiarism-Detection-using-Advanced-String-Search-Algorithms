# Plagiarism-Detection-using-Advanced-String-Search-Algorithms

Plagiarism detection using Naive Algorithm, KMP algorithm, Rabin Karp Algorithm, LCSS Algorithm and Boyer Moore Algorithm mainly focuses on checking the level of plagiarism in the input file when compared with the source file that we have in the database. I have kept the similarity threshold value of 70.00 in my program but this can be changed by the user accordingly.

This is a perfect tool which is designed using Java programming language and five string matching algorithms. Analysis of the code for optimization of all these algorithms on several test cases and their Best, Average and Worst Case time complexities has been done.
